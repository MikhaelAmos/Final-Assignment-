# Final Assignment 
The goal of this assignment is to predict three petrophysical parameters: Vshale, Effective Porosity, and Water Saturation using machine learning. Before applying machine learning, data cleansing was performed by filtering out irrelevant logs such as GR, RHOB, and RT. Manual petrophysical calculations were performed using Python for all wells, and the outputs were Vshale, Effective Porosity, and Water Saturation. The outputs were filtered to choose only the wells with good distribution, and then the data was split into blind and model sets. The model set was used to train the machine learning model. Finally, the blind set was used to validate the trained model.
